Description: This is an IOS game of craps a popular and somewhat complicated dice game when
played in the casino. The first version will be designed to just get the game out and let
users have fun. I would like to eventually add multi user and a teaching mode for people 
who want to learn how to play "casino" craps. 

Things to do.
1. Roll two dice, each a standard 6 sided die. Generate random number on each die. The combined
   total of the two dice will add up to 2 to 12. That sum will be used to determine if the 
   user wins or loses. They will be paid simulated money.
   
2. User interface will include a representation of 1/2 of a craps table. All they user to 
   touch the screen to select the amount to bet, what to bet and roll the dice. Need to 
   simulate two dice rolling and display the result with a graphic that represents the number
   that was rolled. Also have popup messages to indicate to the user if they won or lost and
   the amount that they won. Need representation of the users cash (start with some base 
   amount) Store amount in Game Center info. If they get to zero reset and allow them to 
   start over at initial amount. Keep track of winnings so that the user can come back to 
   where they left off.
   
3. Betting - to start the game (round) the user has to have a Pass line or don't pass line
   bet. Your first roll, the come out roll, will establish your point. The users point can 
   be 4,5,6,8,9, or 10. On the come out roll you win immediately on a 7 or 11, you lose on 
   a 2,3, or 12. 
	Pass Line bets - This bet says that you are betting that you will roll the number you 
	                 get (your point) before you roll a seven.
	               - has to be minium table stakes $5, $10 etc ....
	               - pass line bets are even money. So if you bet $5 you win $5
	               - User can place odds which get paid more money based on the point and
	                 the amount bet. Odds bets are placed directly behind the pass line bet.
	                 
	Don't pass line bet - This bet says that you will roll a seven before you roll your point. 
	               		- has to be minium table stakes $5, $10 ....
	               		- dont pass line bets are even money. So if you bet $5 you win $5
	               		- User can place odds which get paid more money based on the point
	               		  and the amount bet. Odds for the don't pass are calculated differently
	               		  than odds for pass line bets.  Odds bets are placed directly 
	               		  behind the pass line bet.
	                 
	Place bets - have to be table minium ie $5, $10 etc ...
			   - Usually done after the point has been established, but can be bet before
	             the come out roll. If the user places them and says they are "working" bets
	             then these bets are subject to the same rules for if a seven is rolled then
	             these bets are lost. If a two, three or twelve are rolled then no action 
	             is taken.
	           - place bets by default are paid odds and can be raised lowered or taken down
	             while the game is going on, before the roll of a seven. It is encouraged, 
	             but not a rule that the user make place bets in certain increments to make
	             calculating the payment easier and give the player a little more money. 
	             So fours and tens are what ever amount. At least table minium, but encouraged
	             in increments of 5. Five and nine are encouraged that the amount be an even
	             number ie (10, 20, 30). Six and eight are encouraged in increments of 6
	             ie 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and so on. The way the odds are calculated this pays
	             the player a little better and gets away from fractions of a dollar which 
	             don't get paid. 
	           - place bets can be turned off, meaning there is not action on these bets so
	             the user neither wins or loses on them, even if the number is rolled or a 
	             seven is rolled. 
	             
	One Roll Bets - Can be as little as $1 and go up to table maximum
				  - only count for the current roll. The are normally located in the middle
				    of the table near the stick man. They are crap check (C) or 2, 3, 12
				    (some places push on 12, some pay it), Yo bets (E) or 11, Any Craps 
				    (2,3, or 12), Any seven, Horn bet (2, 3, 11, 12), Aces (2), Ace duce (3)
				    Twelve. Any of these bets can be parlayed if they win. That means take 
				    the original bet plus the money from the win and place it back on the
				    same number for the next roll.
				    
	Hard Ways - Can be as little as $1 and go up to table maximum
	          - These are 4, 6, 8, and 10, the numbers that can have the same number on
	            each die. so 2 and 2, 3 and 3, 4 and 4, and 5 and 5. The 6, 6 is excluded 
	            since its considered crap dice and cannot be a point. (most of the time, I
	            have played a table where anything except a 7 could be a point. The odds are
	            not any better for the player.)
	          - the player wins on these numbers if and only if the dice roll that way. In
	            other words the dice have to show 2,2 to get paid for the hard 4. If the 
	            dice roll a 4 any other way, the bet is lost.  The player also has the option
	            to parlay this bet as well. The bet can be pressed (ie added to at anytime
	            the bet is active). 
	          - the player has the option to turn to bet off at anytime. Most of the time 
	            these bets are turned off on the come out roll. A lot of sevens tend to 
	            be rolled and if the bet, if active is lost if a non hard 4,6,8, or 10 are
	            rolled. So they can be active and the player is usually asked if they want 
	            them on or off on the come out.
	            
	            
	The odds - this is where you make your money. Odds pay bonus money if bet based on the 
	           point or number you bet on. The harder the number is to roll the higher the
	           odds. Ie: 2,3 and 12 have the highest odds because you can only roll the 2
	           and 12 one way. A pair of 1s or a paid of 6s, these numbers pay 31 to 1. The
	           six and the eight on the other hand are easy to roll. You can for example 
	           roll a six by getting a 1 & 5, 2 & 4, 3 & 3, and you have to flip it around 
	           and say 5 & 1, 4 & 2. Its a statistics thing. The way to read these is, if I
	           say 2 to 3, would be for every 2 dollars bet you win 3.
	                       
	           Pass line 1 to 1 or whats called even money.
	           Don't pass 1 to 1
	           
	           Odds on numbers for pass line:
	           4 or 10 -> 1 to 2
	           5 or 9 ->  2 to 3
	           6 or 8 ->  5 to 6
	           
	           Odds on numbers for don't pass:
	           4 or 10 -> 2 to 1
	           5 or 9 -> 3 to 2
	           6 ir 8 -> 6 to 5
	           
	           Field Bet:
	           2 or 12 -> 2 to 1
	           the rest of the numbers 3,4,5,9,10, and 11 are all even money 1 to 1.
	           
	           Big 6 and Big 8 are 1 to 1. (not really worth betting)
	           
	           Place bets:
	           Place 4 to win 9 to 5
	           place 5 to win 7 to 5
	           place 6 to win 7 to 6
	           place 8 to win 7 to 6
	           place 9 to win 7 to 5
	           place 10 to win 9 to 5
	           
	           place 4 to lose 5 to 11
	           place 5 to lose 5 to 8
	           place 6 to lose 4 to 5
	           place 8 to lose 4 to 5
	           place 9 to lose 5 to 8
	           place 10 to lose 5 to 11
